Create an AWS user\nIt will recommend creating a dedicated user for S3 access. To do this, go into [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) and create a new user. The access type should be set to **programmatic access**.\n### 2. Set the required rights\nIn order for the user to use the S3 service, he must be [given](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/details/manage-permissions/) the correct rights. To do this, select the desired user and assign it to the predefined **policy** named **AmazonS3FullAccess**.\n### 3. Create access key\nFor DevNotes to use the S3 service, an [access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html) must be created for the user.\n### 4. Create S3 bucket\nIn a bucket, files can be stored. Set up a [new bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/de_de/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html#create-bucket-intro). It should be noted that the *public access* may **not** be blocked!\n### 5. CORS configuration\nThe default settings of an S3 bucket deny any access outside the Amazon cloud! For DevNotes to save / load files, a CORS configuration must [be set](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html#how-do-i-enable-cors). You can copy the following configuration:\n```xml\n<CORSConfiguration xmlns=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/\">\n<CORSRule>\n    <AllowedOrigin>{corsOrigin}</AllowedOrigin>\n    <AllowedMethod>HEAD</AllowedMethod>\n    <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>\n    <AllowedMethod>PUT</AllowedMethod>\n    <AllowedMethod>POST</AllowedMethod>\n    <AllowedMethod>DELETE</AllowedMethod>\n    <ExposeHeader>ETag</ExposeHeader>\n    <ExposeHeader>x-amz-meta-custom-header</ExposeHeader>\n    <AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>\n</CORSRule>\n</CORSConfiguration>\n```"
